wb_msr folder (water balance _ multi-scale routing)

organize_basins.R - reads in csv files, combines and explores with plots

water balance model outputs - entire basin or patch fam: 
share_bas_wPavement_50tree.csv - model output of patch family with 50% tree 
share_bas_wPavement_50grass.csv - model output of patch family with 50% turfgrass
share_bas_wPavement_50.csv - model output of patch family with 50% impervious 

drt_vars.rds - model output of year day during 2012-2016 drought, with different categories of patch family, irrigation scenario, veg param uncertainty, and sharing param uncertainty. Model output include tree fluxes only, water (et) and carbon (npp, gpp = cdf.psn_to_cpool)


variables
- run - ID for turfgrass parameter uncertainty
- sh - sharing coefficient value 
- irr - irrigation scenario, either on/off/-25% 
- patch_fam - set up of patch family 
- yd - day of year 
- year 
- surface_transfer - amount of surface water towards the tree patch (negative means tree is losing water)
- sub_trans - amount of subsurface water towards the tree patch (positive is gaining, negative is losing)
- et - evapotranspiration from tree
- npp - net primary productivity from tree patch 
- cdf.psn_to_cpool - photosynthesis from tree patch 
- sp_code - species of tree 
- watbal - water balance, internally calculated, not accurate 
- date
- month 
- day
- total_water_in - rain and irrigation
- streamflow - total runoff from patch family 
- recharge - total infiltration 
- rain
